# Lexical_Analyzer
This project implements a Lexical Analyzer, the first phase of a compiler, designed to process source code and break it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. It reads the input program, identifies lexical patterns, and generates a structured token stream for further compilation or interpretation.
